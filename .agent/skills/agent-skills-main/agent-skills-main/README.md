# Agent Skills for Streamlit Development

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for building Streamlit applications with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI-powered development tools.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are specialized instruction sets that enhance AI coding assistants' capabilities for specific tasks. Each skill contains instructions, scripts, and resources that the AI loads dynamically to improve performance on Streamlit development workflows.

## Available skills

The main skill is [`developing-with-streamlit`](developing-with-streamlit/SKILL.md), which routes to specialized sub-skills:
